# Pocket Tanks

## About
The fastest game of artillery you'll ever play. Pocket Tanks is designed to be easy to learn, and fun to master. All the excitement of lobbing projectiles over a mound of dirt without all the complicated details found in most artillery games. Select your angle, power, and fire with distinct weapons at your opponent.
Pocket Tanks was originally by Michael P. Welch (Author of DX-Ball & Scorched Tanks).
